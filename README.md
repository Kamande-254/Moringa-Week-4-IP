# Moringa-Week-4-IP
Independent Project - Week 4: Presented by James Muguro

In this project we will seek to determine:
1. The most popular hour of the day for picking up a shared electric car (Bluecar) in the city of Paris over the month of April 2018.
2. The most popular hour for returning cars.
3. The most popular station overall and at the most popular picking hour.
4. The most popular postal code for picking up Blue cars and whether our most popular station belongs to that postal code.
5. The effect on our results if we consider Utilib and Utilib 1.4 instead of Blue cars
